# University Course Registration System

The program is a basic system for the maintenance of students' academic records at a university. `registrar.py` contains program logic, and `registration.py` allows the user to run the program in the command line. If you would like data to persist beyond the current session, users must save the data to a .pickle file. 

## Getting Started 

- Call `python3 registration.py` to start the interactive command prompt
- Type `14` or `Ctrl-C` to quit

## Features & Functionality  

#### Course  
A class representing a course offered (possibly repeatedly) at a university (e.g., MPCS 55001 at University of Chicago).  
  
Attributes
- department (e.g., MATH, MPCS, PHYSICS, STATS, ENGLISH)
- number (e.g., 55001)
- name (e.g., Algorithms)
- credits (An integer value. The number of credits awarded for passing the course.)

#### CourseOffering 
A class representing a specific offering of a course. This class combines the general idea of a course (e.g., Algorithms offered on a regular basis at the school) with a specific instance of it being offered (e.g., Fall 2017).    

Attributes  
- course (An instance of the Course class.)
- section_number (A section number for the offering (e.g. 1))
- instructor (e.g., Joe Smith)
- year (e.g., 2017)
- quarter (e.g., FALL)

Behavior    
- _register_students_ : Takes an arbitrary number of instances of the student class and adds the students to the course.
- _get_students_ : Returns a list of instances of the Student class representing those that have registered for the course.
- _submit_grade_ : Takes an instance of the student class OR a student username and a letter grade (e.g., A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, â€¦) and sets the student's letter grade for the course. If the grade has already been set, this operation overwrites the existing grade.  
- _get_grade_ : Takes an instance of the student class OR a student username and returns the student's letter grade.

#### Institution  
A class representing a university (e.g., University of Chicago).  

Attributes
- name (e.g. University of Chicago)
- domain (e.g. `@uchicago.edu`)

Behavior  
- _list_students_ : Return a list of all students enrolled.
- _enroll_student_ : Accept an instance of the Student class and adds it.
- _list_instructors_ : Return a list of all instructors employed at the university.
- _hire_instructor_ : Accept an instance of the instructor class and add it.
- _list_course_catalog_: Return a list of all courses available at the university.

- _add_course_ : Adds an instance of the Course class to the university's course catalog.
- _add_course_offering_ : Takes an instance of the Course class and adds it to the university's course schedule.

A class representing the people involved with the university.    
  
Attributes
- last_name

- username (Equivalent to UChicago CNetID. Used as a unique identifier across the system.)
- affiliation (e.g., student, faculty, staff, etc)
- email (A property. Should resolve to [self.username]@[self.school.domain])

#### Instructor
A class representing an instructor of a course at a university. Inherits from Person class.

#### Student  
A class representing a student at a university. Inherits from Person class.

Behavior
